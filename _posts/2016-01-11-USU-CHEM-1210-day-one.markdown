title: USU - CHEM 1210 - In Class Notes
---

Today, we mostly talked about the syllabus (which you can checkout [here](https://usu.instructure.com/courses/393593/files/?preview=59642630)). And then started into content from the first chapter of the book.

# Syllabus

There are all the normal things - office hours, location, grading scale, and whatnot. But there's also some super cool stuff about grading.

- lowest score on exam gets dropped _(awesome!)_
- There will most likely be an upward curve at the end of class _(also awesome)_
- About 20% of the grade will come from online quizzes you get __unlimited__ attemps on.
    - Questions on the quiz will come from a question bank that he'll most likely draw all the exam questions from and just change numbers. _(favorite)_
- SI (supplemental instruction) on Tuesdays and Thursdays.

These were the key things I noticed. If you saw anything else, email me (or maybe I'll have comments set up by then)

# Chapter 1 Content

All the material he covered is on the slides, which you can find [here](https://usu.instructure.com/courses/393593/files/folder/lecture%20material?preview=59641138). I'll just be adding my own notes and voice to things I thought were pertinent

## Matter

Matter can be composed from about 100 different elements

## States of matter

- Gas - no definite volume or shape
- Liquid - definite volume, not shape __(important, I saw this on the pre-quiz for chapter 1)__
- Solid - definite volume and shape

### Pure substances

__pure substances__ have definite proportions of elements

__Example:__ water is $$H_2O$$ and will always have that same chamical makeup

### Mixtures

Mixtures have at least two substances and, unlike pure substances, will have different ratios of elements at different points. 

He used the example of pooring sugar into a bucket of water. Until the salt has been sifficiently mixed into the water, there will be varying quantities of salt and water.

__note:__ mixtures can be solids, gasses, or liquids - concrete, steel, clouds, etc

### Homogeneous vs Heterogeneous

> Hetero-: Prefix meaning different... The opposite of hetero- is homo-  
> Homo - Greek prefix meaning "the same", opposite of "hetero-"

mixtures can be homogeneous or heterogeneous

- homogeneous: uniform composition - "get exactly the same thing no matter where you take a sample from"
- heterogeneous: __non__uniform composition - "get different compositions at different places in sample."

__Examples:__

_Homogeneous:_  steel, air, sugar solution

_Heterogeneous:_ cloud, rock, lumps of sugar at bottom of solution

    

## Changes

__Saw this on the prequiz too__

- physical
    - changes of state: melting, evaporation, etc
- chemical
    - transformation into different substance

    
## Units of Measurement

Professor Scheiner said we'll strictly be working with the [metric](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metric_system) system. So, that's pretty much what the rest of the lecture was about.

metric: 
SI Scale

- kg
- m
- s

|PhysicalQuantity|Name of Unit|Abbreviation
|---|---|---|
|Mass|Kilogram|kf
|Length|Meter|m|
|Time|Second|$$s^a$$|
|Temerature|Kelvin|K|
|Amount of substance|Mole|mol|

meter is the basic 

### measure of length

- c = centi = $$10^2$$
- k = kilo = $$10^3$$
- M = mega = $$10^6$$
- $$\mu$$ = micro = $$10^6$$

### Temerature

- $$C$$ Celsius
    - freezes at $$0$$ and boils at $$100$$
- $$K$$ Kelvin
    - freezes at 273 and boils at 373

### Volume (derived unit)

$$length^3$$

$$cm^3 = mL$$

### Uncertainty in Measurement

- Precision = mutual agreement
- Accuracy = Closeness to true value


### Significant Figures
> Only write those figures whose value is truly known (plus one)

the last digit is uncertain
