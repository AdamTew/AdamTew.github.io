title: USU Chemistry 1210 - Day One
---

Today, we mostly talked about the syllabus (which you can checkout here). And then started into content from the first chapter of the book.

Syllabus
There are all the normal things - office hours, location, grading scale, and whatnot. But there's also some super cool stuff about grading.

lowest score on exam gets dropped (awesome!)
There will most likely be an upward curve at the end of class (also awesome)
About 20% of the grade will come from online quizzes you get unlimited attemps on.
Questions on the quiz will come from a question bank that he'll most likely draw all the exam questions from and just change numbers. (favorite)
SI (supplemental instruction) on Tuesdays and Thursdays.
These were the key things I noticed. If you saw anything else, email me (or maybe I'll have comments set up by then)

Chapter 1 Content
All the material he covered is on the slides, which you can find here. I'll just be adding my own notes and voice to things I thought were pertinent

Matter
Matter can be composed from about 100 different elements

States of matter
Gas - no definite volume or shape
Liquid - definite volume, not shape (important, I saw this on the pre-quiz for chapter 1)
Solid - definite volume and shape
Pure substances

pure substances have definite proportions of elements

Example: water is H2O and will always have that same chamical makeup

Mixtures

Mixtures have at least two substances and, unlike pure substances, will have different ratios of elements at different points.

He used the example of pooring sugar into a bucket of water. Until the salt has been sifficiently mixed into the water, there will be varying quantities of salt and water.

note: mixtures can be solids, gasses, or liquids - concrete, steel, clouds, etc

Homogeneous vs Heterogeneous

Hetero-: Prefix meaning different... The opposite of hetero- is homo-
Homo - Greek prefix meaning "the same", opposite of "hetero-"
mixtures can be homogeneous or heterogeneous

homogeneous: uniform composition - "get exactly the same thing no matter where you take a sample from"
heterogeneous: nonuniform composition - "get different compositions at different places in sample."
Examples:

Homogeneous: steel, air, sugar solution

Heterogeneous: cloud, rock, lumps of sugar at bottom of solution

Changes
Saw this on the prequiz too

physical
changes of state: melting, evaporation, etc
chemical
transformation into different substance
Units of Measurement
Professor Scheiner said we'll strictly be working with the metric system. So, that's pretty much what the rest of the lecture was about.

metric: SI Scale

kg
m
s
PhysicalQuantity    Name of Unit    Abbreviation
Mass    Kilogram    kf
Length  Meter   m
Time    Second  s^a
Temerature  Kelvin  K
Amount of substance Mole    mol
meter is the basic

measure of length

c = centi = 102
k = kilo = 103
M = mega = 106
Î¼ = micro = 106
Temerature

C Celsius
freezes at 0 and boils at 100
K Kelvin
freezes at 273 and boils at 373
Volume (derived unit)

length3
cm3=mL
Uncertainty in Measurement

Precision = mutual agreement
Accuracy = Closeness to true value
Significant Figures

Only write those figures whose value is truly known (plus one)
the last digit is uncertain
