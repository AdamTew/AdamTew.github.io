# Introduction: Matter and Measurement

> __Chemistry__ is the study of matter and the changes that matter undergoes.
> 
> The first chapter provides an overview of what chemistry is about and what chemists do.



## 1.1 The Study of Chemistry

> We begin with a brief description of what chemistry is, what chemsists do, and why it is useful to learn chemistry

### The Atomic and Molecular Perspective of Chemistry

> Chemistry is the study of the properties and behavior of matter.

- __Matter__ - the physical material of the universe. Anything that has __mass__ and occupies space
- __Property__ - any characteristic that allows us to recognize a particular type of matter and to distinguish it from other types
- __Elements__ - about 100. Composed of atoms
- __Atoms__ - the almost infinitesimally small building block of matter
    + __composition__
    + __structure__
- __molecules__ - two or more atoms joined together ina specific shape

- __macroscopic__ - realm of ordinary-sized objects
- __microscopic__ - realm of atoms and molecules

### Why Study Chemistry?

... Because it's awesome...

> chemistry is the _central science_, central to a fundamental understanding of other sciences and technologies.

## 1.2 Classifications of Matter

> Next, we examine some fundamental ways to classify matter, distinguishing between _pure substances_ and _mixtures_ and between _elements_ and _compounds_.

> two principal ways of classifying matter are according to physical state (gas, liquid, or solid) and according to composition (element, compound, or mixture).

### States of Matter

- __States of Matter__ - (_simple states_) gas, solid, or a liquid
- __Gas__ _(vapor)_ - no fixed volume or shape; rather, it conforms to the volume and shape of its container. A gas can be compressed to occupy a smaller volume, or it can expand to occupy a larger one.
- __Liquid__ - has a distinct volume independent of its container but has no specific shape. It assumes the shape of the portion of the container it occupies.
- __Solid__ - has both a definite shape and a definite volume.

_Note:_ neither liquids or solids can be compressed to any appreciable extent.

- distance between atoms in molecules
    + gas - furthest apart and fastest moving
    + liquid - far apart and quickly moving, but not as fast as gas
    + solid - closests together and slowest moving

> the distance betweenmolecules are similar in the liquid and solid states, but the two states differ in how free the molecules are to move around. Changes in temperature and/or pressure can lead to conversion from one state of matter to another, illustrated by such familiar processes as ice melting or water vapor condensing

### Pure Substances

> Most forms of matter we encounter .... are not chemically pure. We can, however, separate these forms of matter into pure substances.

- __Pure Substance__ - _(usually referred to as just a substance)_ is matter that has disting properties and composition that does not vary from sample to sample
    + __elements__ - substances that cannot be decomposed into simpler 
    + __substances__ - compounds - substances composed of two or more elements; they contain two or more kinds of atoms
- __Mixtures__ - combinations of two or more substances in which each substance retains its chemical identity

### Elements

> currently, 118 elements are known, though they vary widely in abundance. For example, only fie elements--oxygen, silicon, aluminum, iron, and calcium-- acount for over 90% of Eearth's crust (including oceans and atmosphere) and only three--oxygen, carbon, and hydrogen--acount for over 90% of the mass of the human body

### Compounds

> Most elements can interact with other elements to form compounds.

### Mixtures

- __Heterogeneous__ - quantities can vary throughout the mixture
- __Homogeneous__ - mixtures that are uniform *(also knows as __solutions__)*

> Although the term _solution_ conjures an image of a liquid, solutions can be solids, liquids, or gases.

## 1.3 Properties of Matter

> every substance has unique properties

- __Physical Properties__ - can be observed without changing the identity and composition o the substance. These properties include color, odor, density, melting point, boiling point, and hardness.
- __Chemical properties__ - describe the way a substance may change, or react, to form another substance.
- __Intensive properties__ - Do not depend on the amount of sample being examined and are particularly useful in chemistry because many intnsie properties an be used to _identify_ substances
- __Extensive properties__ - depend on the amount of sample, with two examples being mas and volume. Extensive properties relate to the _amount_ of substance present

### Physical and Chemical Changes

> The changes substances undergo are either physical or chemical.

- __Physical Change__ - changes physical appearance but not composition
    + All __changes of state__ are physical (from gas to liquid to solid, etc)
- __Chemical Change__ (Chemical reaction) - a substance is changed into a chemically different substance

### Separation of Mixtures

- filtration - using a filter to separate
- __distillation__ - a method of separating the components of a homogeneous mixture 
- __Chromatography__ - 

## 1.4 Units of Measurement

- __Metric System__ - System for scientific measurements

### SI Units

> In 1960 an international agreement was reached specifying a particular choice of metric units for use in scientific measurements. Tese preferred units are called __SI units__, after the French _System International d'Unites_

|Physical Quantity|Name of Unit|Abbreviation|
|---|---|---|
|Mass|Kilogram|kg|
|Length|Meter|m|
|Time|Second|s or sec|
|Termperature|Kelvin|K|
|Amount of substance|Mole|mol|
|Electric current|Ampere|A or amp|
|Luminous intensity|Candela|cd|

<br />__Prefixes used in Metric System with SI Units__

|Prefix|Abbreviation|Meaning|Example|
|---|---|---|---|
|Peta|P|$$10^{15}$$|1 petawatt(pW) $$ = 1 X 10^{15}$$ watts
|Tera|T|$$10^{12}$$|1 terawatt(tW) $$ = 1 X 10^{12}$$ watts
|Giga|G|$$10^9$$|1 gigawatt(gW) $$ = 1 X 10{^9}$$ watts
|Mega|M|$$10^6$$|1 megawatt(mW) $$ = 1 X 10{^6}$$ watts
|Kilo|k|$$10^3$$|1 kilowatt(kW) $$ = 1 X 10{^3}$$ watts
|Deci|d|$$10^{-1}$$|1 deciwatt(dW) $$ = 1 X 10^{-1}$$ watts
|Centi|c|$$10^{-2}$$|1 centiwatt(cW) $$ = 1 X 10^{-2}$$ watts
|Milli|m|$$10^{-3}$$|1 milliwatt(mW) $$ = 1 X 10^{-3}$$ watts
|Micro|$$\mu^b$$|$$10^{-6}$$|1 microwatt(mW) $$ = 1 X 10^{-6}$$ watts
|Nano|n|$$10^{-9}$$|1 nanowatt(nW) $$ = 1 X 10^{-9}$$ watts
|Pico|p|$$10^{-12}$$|1 picowatt(pW) $$ = 1 X 10^{-12}$$ watts
|Femto|f|$$10^{-15}$$|1 femtowatt(fW) $$ = 1 X 10^{-15}$$ watts
|Atto|a|$$10^{-18}$$|1 attowatt(aW) $$ = 1 X 10^{-18}$$ watts
|Zepto|z|$$10^{-21}$$|1 zeptowatt(zW) $$ = 1 X 10^{-21}$$ watts

### Length and Mass

- __Mass__ - A measure of the amount of material in an object

### Temperature

- __Temperature__ - A measure of the hotness or coldness of an object
    + determines the __direction of heat flow__

Heat always flows spontaneously from a substance at higher temperature to one at lower temperature.

- __Celsius scale__ - originally based on the assignment of 0 C to the freezing point of water and 100 C to its boiling point at sea level
- __Kelvin__ - is the SI temperature scale
    + Zero on the Kelvin scale is the lowest attainabl temperature, -273 C, referred to as _absolute zero_

$$K = \ ^oC + 273.15$$

### Derived SI Units

$$\frac{m}{s}$$ "Meters per second" is a derived unit

Two common derived units in chemistry are those for volume and density

### Volume

> The _volume_ of a cube is its length cubes, (length)$$^3$$. Thus, the derived SI unit of volume is  the SI unit of length, m, raised to the third power.

$$1 mL = 1 cm^3$$

### Density

> Density is defined as the amount of mass in a unit of volume of a substance

$$Density = \frac{mass}{volume}$$

## 1.5 Uncertainty in Measurement

- __Exact Numbers__ - those whose values are known exactly
- __Inexact Numbers__ - those whose values have some uncertainty
    + numbers obtained by measurements are always inexact

### Precision and Accuracy

> The terms _precision_ and _accuracy_ are often used in discussing the unvertainties of measured values.

- __Precision__ - A measure of how closely individual measurement agree with one another
- __Accuracy__ - refers to how closely individual measurements agree with the correct, or "true," value

### Significant Figures

> *there is alwaus some uncertainty in the last digit reported for any measured quantity.*

- __Significant figures__ - All digits of a measured quantity, including the uncertain one
    + Zeros between nonzero digits are always significant
    + Zeros at the beginning of a number are never significant; they merely indicate the position of the decimal point
    + Zeros at the end ofa number are significant if the number contains a decimal point

### Significant Figures in Calculations

> When carrying measured quantities through calculations, the least certain measurement limits the certainty of the calculated quantity and thereby determines the number of significant figures in the final answer. The final answer should be reported with only one uncertain digit.

- __Addition__ - round to the smallest decimal place
- __Multiplication__ - Round to the smallest decimal place

## 1.6 Dimensional Analysis

> Using dimensional analysis helps ensure that solutions to problems yield the proper units. Moreover, it provides a systematic way of solving many numerical problems and of checking solutions for possible errors.

- __Conversion Factor__ - A fraction whose numerator and denominator are the same quantity expressed in diferent units

__Example:__ 2.54 $$cm$$ and 1 $$in$$ are the same length, $$2.54cm = 1in$$. This relationship allows us to write two conversion factors:

$$\frac{2.54cm}{1in} \text{ and } \frac{1in}{2.54cm}$$

### Using Two or More Conversion Factors

### Conversions Involving Volume
