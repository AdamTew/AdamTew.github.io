# Introduction: Matter and Measurement

> __Chemistry__ is the study of matter and the changes that matter undergoes.
> 
> The first chapter provides an overview of what chemistry is about and what chemists do.



## 1.1 The Study of Chemistry

> We begin with a brief description of what chemistry is, what chemsists do, and why it is useful to learn chemistry

### The Atomic and Molecular Perspective of Chemistry

> Chemistry is the study of the properties and behavior of matter.

- __Matter__ - the physical material of the universe. Anything that has __mass__ and occupies space
- __Property__ - any characteristic that allows us to recognize a particular type of matter and to distinguish it from other types
- __Elements__ - about 100. Composed of atoms
- __Atoms__ - the almost infinitesimally small building block of matter
    + __composition__
    + __structure__
- __molecules__ - two or more atoms joined together ina specific shape

- __macroscopic__ - realm of ordinary-sized objects
- __microscopic__ - realm of atoms and molecules

### Why Study Chemistry?

... Because it's awesome...

> chemistry is the _central science_, central to a fundamental understanding of other sciences and technologies.

## 1.2 Classifications of Matter

> Next, we examine some fundamental ways to classify matter, distinguishing between _pure substances_ and _mixtures_ and between _elements_ and _compounds_.

> two principal ways of classifying matter are according to physical state (gas, liquid, or solid) and according to composition (element, compound, or mixture).

### States of Matter

- __States of Matter__ - (_simple states_) gas, solid, or a liquid
- __Gas__ _(vapor)_ - no fixed volume or shape; rather, it conforms to the volume and shape of its container. A gas can be compressed to occupy a smaller volume, or it can expand to occupy a larger one.
- __Liquid__ - has a distinct volume independent of its container but has no specific shape. It assumes the shape of the portion of the container it occupies.
- __Solid__ - has both a definite shape and a definite volume.

_Note:_ neither liquids or solids can be compressed to any appreciable extent.

- distance between atoms in molecules
    + gas - furthest apart and fastest moving
    + liquid - far apart and quickly moving, but not as fast as gas
    + solid - closests together and slowest moving

> the distance betweenmolecules are similar in the liquid and solid states, but the two states differ in how free the molecules are to move around. Changes in temperature and/or pressure can lead to conversion from one state of matter to another, illustrated by such familiar processes as ice melting or water vapor condensing

### Pure Substances

> Most forms of matter we encounter .... are not chemically pure. We can, however, separate these forms of matter into pure substances.

- __Pure Substance__ - _(usually referred to as just a substance)_ is matter that has disting properties and composition that does not vary from sample to sample
    + __elements__ - substances that cannot be decomposed into simpler 
    + __substances__ - compounds - substances composed of two or more elements; they contain two or more kinds of atoms
- __Mixtures__ - combinations of two or more substances in which each substance retains its chemical identity

### Elements

> currently, 118 elements are known, though they vary widely in abundance. For example, only fie elements--oxygen, silicon, aluminum, iron, and calcium-- acount for over 90% of Eearth's crust (including oceans and atmosphere) and only three--oxygen, carbon, and hydrogen--acount for over 90% of the mass of the human body

### Compounds

> Most elements can interact with other elements to form compounds.

### Mixtures

- __Heterogeneous__ - quantities can vary throughout the mixture
- __Homogeneous__ - mixtures that are uniform *(also knows as __solutions__)*

> Although the term _solution_ conjures an image of a liquid, solutions can be solids, liquids, or gases.

## 1.3 Properties of Matter

> We then consider different characteristics, or properties, used to characterize, identify, and separate substances.

## 1.4 Unites of Measurement

## 1.5 Uncertainty in Measurement

## 1.6 Dimensional Analysis
