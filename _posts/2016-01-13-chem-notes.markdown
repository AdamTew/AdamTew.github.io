- prequiz 1 ends tonight
- prequiz 2 ends tomorrow night
- SI starts next week

# Chapter 1 Content

_slides for this lecture are [here](https://usu.instructure.com/courses/393593/files/folder/lecture%20material?preview=59641138)_

## Review

- mixtures can be homogeneous or heterogeneous
- elements
- compounds
- changes
    + physical
    + chemical
- unites of measurement
- scales
    + prefixes (memorize metric system)
- for temperature we'll be using celcius and kelvin
    + 1 temperature change in celcius is the same as 1 change in kelvin
- volume
- significant figures
    + $$234.5$$ has 4 significant figures
    + 234.53097 has 8 significant figures
    + the last digit is a little unclear

## New Material

### Scientific Notation

form: $$a.bc x 10^m$$

- always write one digit before the decimal point
    + 234.5 becomes $$2.345 * 10^2$$ - 4 significant figures
    + 0.000352 becomes $$3.52 * 10^4$$ - 3 significant figures

### Rules of Arithmetic Operations

#### Multiplication / Division
> significant figures in final answer equal to that of number used that has _smallest_ number of significant figures.

__Example__

12 becomes $$1.2 * 10^2$$

#### Addition / Subtraction
> Write all numbers side by side, then cut off at last significant figure
> 
> round the number before the one you're getting rid of.

__Example__
234.5
  6.5__2417__
 35.8__2__
______________

#### Rounding

## Dimensional Analysis

> in science numbers almost always have units with them.
> Every physical quantity has a unit with it

$$k$$ means kilo

example: $$10^3 / 1km = 1$$

$$3km\left(\frac{10^3m}{km}\right) = 3x10^3m$$

> denominator of a denominator is a numberator

## Conversion Factors for Derived Quantities

Basically you'll need to get a nice list of all the differnt conversions and use it a lot. Hopefully get it memorized

and that concludes chapter 1

# Chapter 2

## Elements

> irreducible form of matter
> atoms (definition: indivisible)

- elemnts composed of atoms
- all atoms of same leemnt are identical
- chemical reactions to _not_ change properties of atoms
- atoms not created or destroyed (molecules are, atoms are not)

### Electrons:

Thomson Experiment

### Radioactivity

> spontaneous emission of high-energy radiation  
> the spontaneous vomitting of an infant

$$\alpha, \beta$$ are particles (matter)

$$\beta = e^-$$

$$\beta$$

$$\alpha = He$$ nucleus

---

- all positive charges reside in the nucleus
- electrons fly around the outside

angstrom $$\AA$$ is used a lot with atoms, so you might want to write it down

### Atomic Structure

- p = protons
- n = neutrons
- e = elections

> Atom's identity is determined by number of protons (called atomic number)

- number of neutrons are independant of protons.

$$^{12}C$$ and $$^{13}C$$ (pronounced 'C' 12 and 'C' 13 ) are isotopes

next time we'll talk about atomic weight and mass
