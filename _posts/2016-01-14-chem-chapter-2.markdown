# Atoms, Molecules, and Ions

> lIn a sense, the atoms are like the 26 letters of the English alphabet that join in different combinations to form the immense number of words in our language

## 2.1 The Atomic Theory of Matter

- Dalton'sTheory
    1. Each element is composed of extremely small particles called atoms
    2. All atoms of a given element are identical, but the atoms of one element are different from the atoms of all other elements.
    3. Atoms of one element cannot be changed int oatoms of a different element by chemical reactions; atoms are neither created nor destroyed in chemical reactions.
    4. Compounds are formed when atoms of more than one element combine; a given compound always has the same relative number and kind of atoms.

## 2.2 The Discovery of Atomic Structure

- __subatomic particles__ - the parts of an atom

### Cathode Rays and Electrons

- __cathode rays__ - radiation produced between electrodes

### Radioactivity

 - __Radioactivity__ - The spontaneous emission of radiation

### The Nuclear Model of the Atom

- __Nuclear Model__ - Most of the mass of an atom and all of its positive charge reside in a very small, extremely dense region - the __nucleus__
- __Protons__ - positive particles
- __Neutrons__ - negative particles

## 2.3 The Modern View of Atomic Sructure

> only three subatomic particles--the __proton__, __neuton__, and __electron__-- have a bearing on chemical bahvior

- __electronic charge__ - the quantity $$1.602 \times 10^{-19} C$$
- __electron__ - 1-
    + mas of $$5.486 * 10^{-4}$$ amu
- __proton__ - 1+
    + reside in the nucleus
    + mass of of 1.0073 amu
- __neutron__ - 1 (neutral)
    + reside in the nucleus
    + mass of 1.0087

__Note:__ Every atom has the same number of electrons and protons, so __atoms have no net electrical charge__

- __atomic mass unit__ (amu) - Used to measure the mass of atoms. 1 amu = $$1.66054 \times 10^{-24} g$$
- __angstrom__ $$\AA$$ - 

### Atomic Numbers, Mass Numbers, and Isotopes

- __Atomic Number__ - The number of protons in an atom
- __Mass Number__ - the number of protons plus neutrons in the atom

$$^{\text{Mass Number(number of protons plus neutrons) }\ \rightarrow\ 12}_{\text{Atomic Number(number of protons or electrons) }\ \rightarrow\ 6}C\leftarrow \text{Symbol of element}$$

- __Isotopes__  - same number of protons different number of neutrons

## 2.4 Atomic Weights

### Atomic Weight

- __Atomic Weight__ - average atomic mass of an element

### The Atomic Mass Scale

## 2.5 The Periodic Table

> The periodic table is the most significant tool that chemists use for organizing and remembering chemical facts.

- __Periods__ - Horizontal rows
- __Groups__ vertical columns

## 2.6 Molecules and Molecular Compounds

### Molecules and Chemical Formulas

- __Diatomic molecule__ - Molecule made up of two atoms
- __Molecular Compounds__ - Compounds composed of molecules

Elements that normally appear as diatomic molecules:
Hydrogen, oxygen, nitrogen, and the halogens

$$H_2,\ O_2,\ N_2,\ F_2,\ Cl_2,\ Br_2,\ \text{and}\ I_2$$

### Molecular and Empirical Formulas

- __Molecular formulas__ - Chemical formulas that indicate th actual numbers of atoms ina molecule
- __Empirical formulas__ - Chemical formulas that give onle the relatie number of atoms of each type in a molecule

### Picturing Molecules

- __Structural Formula__ - shows which atoms are attached to which

## 2.7 Ions and Ionic Compounds

- __Ion__ - charged particle, formed when electrons are removed from an atom
    + __Cation__ - An ion with a positive charge
    + __anion__ - negatively charged ion

### Predicting Ionic Charges

### Ionic Compounds

## 2.8 Naming Inorganic Compounds



## 2.9 Some Simple Organic Compounds
