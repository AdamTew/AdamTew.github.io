- Tuesday & Thursday, BNR 102, 7:30 - 8:20

- questions: 
    + naming ios (nomanclature)
    + converting density back and forth with mass and volume
        * $$d = \frac{M}{V} $$
        * Usually a two-step process to convert from one unit to another
        * Example: $$\frac{kg}{mL}$$
        * You start by knowing the units
        * $$\frac{kg}{mL} \cdot \frac{1000g}{kg} = \frac{g}{mL}$$

# Review

- elements
- electrons
- radioactivity

"Most important part" - an atom has a ncleus that houses all of the densit (protons and neutrons)

|charge|mass|approx mass|
|---|---|---|
|p = proton|+1|1.007|1
|n = neutron | 0|1.009|1
|e = electron | -1|5.5 x $$10^{-4}|0

- atomic number is the number of protons in an atom
- you may have different numbers of neutrons in the same atom
- atomic weight and mass
    + when you're looking at atoms in nature, you almost never find exact quantities of neutrons, you usually have some variance in neutrons
        * you normally take an average of what is normal
        * the atomic weight of carbon __not the actual, the average of what you'd see in nature__ is 12.01 amu - this is the same number you'd find in the periodic table
        * chlorine 35.5 amu - it comes in 2 __isotopes__ $$^{35}Cl and 25% ^{36}Cl$$

## Periodic Table

> It's just a list of numbers that are grouped together

Li, Na, K (3, 11, 19) are just very similar
He, Ne, Ar (2, 10, 18) are very similar
Cu, Ag, Au (29, 47, 79) are very similar

numbers elements like you'd read a book in english (1 is in the top left, 116 is in the bottom right)

### Structure

- columns all have similar properties (sometimes called families)
    + 1A Alkali metals
    + 7A is Halogens
    + 8A is noble gases
- Rows are called periods

## Molecules

> Molecules are nothing more than __atoms attached to each other__. and their attached with things called atomic binds

- diatomic - two of the same atom
- dioxygen - $$O$$ - unstable
- oxygen - $$O_2$$ - required for life
- ozone - $$O_3$$ - toxic


### Compounds

- $$H_2O$$, $$H_2O_2$$ -  read 'h' two oh and 'h' two 'o' two
- if there's only one atom you ommit the number

### Molecular formula

- shows the actual number of atoms in a compound

### Empirical Formula

- just ratios of numbers of given atoms

### Structural Formula 

- shows what atoms are connectd to what


Oxygen

~~~

H - O - H

~~~


Methane

~~~

    H
    |
H - C - H
    |
    H

~~~

- different types of structures
    - ball and stick    
    - space filling

__ION = non-neutral entity__


- Electron has been added or removed
    + + = cation ($$e^-$$ missing)
    + - = anion ($$e^-$$ added)

$$^{\text{Weight}\ \rightarrow 23}_{\text{Atomic Number} \rightarrow\ 11}NA$$

- everything in the 1A column with almost always be +1
- everything in the 2A column with almost always be +2
- everything in the 7A column with almost always be -1
- everything in the 6A column with almost always be -2

everything else is pretty are to predict

### Ionic bonds

> the ide makes you know it's an anion

#### General Rule

Ionic compounds contain both metal and nonmetal molecules contain nonmetals only

## Nomenclature

- for ionic compounds
    + metal (cation) has same name as atom itself
    + nonmetal (anion): change ending to "ide"

example: 

- NaCl = sodium chlor$$\color{red}{ide}$$
- $$Caf_2$$ = calcium fluoride
- $$Al_2O_3$$ = aluminum oxide

when atoms have more than one charge you use __rrous__ and __rris__

$$Fe^{+2}$$ (iron(II) = ferric  
$$Fe^{+3}$$ (iron(III)) = ferrous

### Naming anions

atoms can aggregate together into a collective ion
