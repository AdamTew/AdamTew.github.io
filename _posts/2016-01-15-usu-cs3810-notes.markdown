- no class next monday (or tuesday)

- __Response Time__ - execution time
    + total time required to task start to execute and complete
- throughput - bandwidth
    + total amount of data worked on in a given time

## Performance x = n * performance y

$\frac{ perform x}{performance y} = n = \frac{ExecutiontimeY}{executionTime X}$$

## CPU execution time (total CPU time)

- __User CPU Time__ - time spent in program
- __system CPU time__ - time spent running background programs

2.4 GHz (gigahertz) clock cycle = $$\frac{1}{2.4e^9} = 4.16e^{-10} = 416 pico? seconds$$

CPU time

$$\text{CPU execution time for a program} = \text{CPU clock cyceles} \cdot \text{clock cycle time}$$

## How to improve Performance

$$\frac{seconds}{program} = \frac{cycles}{programs} \frac{seconds}{cycle}$$

- clock rate = clock cycle

- ET = execution time
- IC = instruction count = # of instructions executed by program


_Note_ the number of instructions take different amounts of time.

$$ET = IC \cdot CPI \cdot CT = total_cycles \cdot CT$$

$$ A: 10 = total\_cycles \cdot \left(\frac{1}{4}GHz\right)$$

$$ B: 6 = 1.2 \cdot total\_cycles \cdot \left(\frac{1}{clock\_rate}\right)$$

$$ \frac{10}{6} = \left(\frac{clock\_rate}{1.2 \cdot 4GHz}\right)$$

$$clock_rate = 8GHz$$
