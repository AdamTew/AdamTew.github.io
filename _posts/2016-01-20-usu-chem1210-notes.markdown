- questions:
- empirical formula
  + reduce 
- What will they look like on the exams?
  + __questions on the exam will look a lot like the quizzes__


## Chapter 2

### Ionic bonds and nomanclature

periodic table

when something becomes and ion it becomes an

general rule:

> Ionic compounds contain both metal and nonmental Molecules caontain nonmetals only

### Nomenclature

NaCl = sodium chloride

CaF$$_2$$ = calcium fluoride

$$Al_2O_2$$ = aluminum oxide

### naming anions

atoms can aggregate together into a collective ion

$$OH^-$$, $$SO_3^-2$$, $$CN^-$$

> very simple ones tend to end in "ide"

|per___ are|__ ite|Hypo___ite|
|---|---|---|---|
|CLI_4^-|ClI_3^-|ClI_2^-|ClI
|perchlorate|Chlorate|Chlorite|Hypochlorite|



### Full name of ionic compounds

cation + anion

$$CaCl_2$$ calcium chlor__ide__

$$NaNO_3$$ sodium __nitrate__

$$fe(NO_2)2$$  fer_rous_ __nitrite__

$$(NH_4)2SO_4$$ _ammonium_ __sulgate__

> These names are as simple as they can be


metal + non-metal = salt

all have definite charge

> Until you get used to these it would be a good ide to refer to [the lists]

__note:__ We'll probably only see the common ions on tests, but there may be others

... Lots of stuff about ionic naming... 

$$CO_2$$ carbod __di__oxide, $$CO$$ carbon __mono__xide

because there's occasion with 1 carbon molecule and 2 molecules, we need to distinguish between both


### Acids

Anion ----> Acid

~~~

______ide  ------> hydro ___ic acid

~~~

### Organic Compounds

- hydrocarbons
- Alkanes 
  + because they only have single bonds
  + named based on the number of bonds
    * meth, eth, prop, but
- any molecule with a double bond does not have a full complement of H atoms, so called "unsaturated"


## Chapter 3

> Now we actually get into chemistry

### Conservation of Mass

- atoms never disappear
  + if you start with 12 and 24 you're gonna end with 12 and 24

Chemical Equation:

$$2\ H_2 + O_2 \rightarrow\ 2\ H_2O$$

$$\text{reactants} \rightarrow \text{products}$$

Equation is "balanced"

> You can only change coeficients, not substripts


in the process of balancing atoms you usually want to end with _oxygen_ because it has so many potentials

> Something plus $$O_2$$ gives you $$CO_2$$ and water [$$H_2O$$]

### Atomic Weight and Mass

> What we've done so far is count the number of atoms

> amu is a physical constant, it is the weight of an atom. If you take one and put it on a scale, that's what you'll get


However, not all atoms have the same __weight__ or __mass__

we're going to define everything by it's __atomic mass unit__ (amu)

$$1\ amu = 1.66 \cdot 10^{-24} g$$

$$H$$ atoms in a gram = $$6.02 \cdot 10^23$$

> the atomic weight you'll see in the periodic table will not be perfect integers because of isotopes

### Formula or Molecular Weight


you take two molecules and add them together

$$1(23.0) + 1(35.5) = 58.5$$

> Just add up all the numbers, very simple

### Percent Composition

> the atomic weight for each element divided by the formula weight of the compound

NaCl = 58.5

%Na  .39%

> how small a sample can we really observe?

Next time we'll be talking about _moles_
