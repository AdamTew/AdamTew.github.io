# Instructions Example

> basically, you're writing a program and you're wondering which will be faster and by how much. Then you want to figure out CPI for each sequence


examples for 

- CPU clock cycles = $$\sum^n_{i=1} (pi \cdot ci)$$

|C|A|B|C|
|---|---|---|
|CPI|1|2|3

---


|Code sequence|A|B|C|
|---|---|---|---|
|2|4|1|1|


CPU cycles$$_1 = (2 \cdot + 1) + (1 \cdot 2) + (2 \cdot 3) = 10$$ cycles

CPU cycles$$_2 = (4 \cdot + 1) + (1 \cdot 2) + (1 \cdot 3) = 9$$ cycles


### Big picture

relate a program in time:

- time = seconds per program = $$\frac{instructions}{programs} \cdot \frac{clock cycles}{instruction} \cdot \frac{seconds}{cycle}$$

> once you switch to multicore processing, CPI doesn't apply
