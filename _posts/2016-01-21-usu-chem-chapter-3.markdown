# Stoichiometry: Calculations with Wchemical Formulas and Equations

- __Stoichiometry__ - the area of study that examines the quantities of substances comsumed and produced in chemical reactions

> Atoms are neither created nor destroyed during a chemical reaction.

## 3.1 Chemical Equations

~~~

reactions represented as an equation

  reacts     
     |      
     v      
2 H2 + O2 ----> 2 H2O
reactants   ^  products
            |
            |
         produces

~~~

### Balancing Equations

> For most purposes, a balanced equation should contain the smallest possible whole-number coefficients

- __Coefficients__ - 
- __Subscripts__ - 

### Indications the Sattes of reactants and Products

sometimes postfixes are used

- (g) - gas
- (l) - liquid
- (s) - solid
- (aq) - aqueous (water)

$$CH_4(g) + 2 O_2(g) \rightarrow CO_2(g) +  2 H_2O(g)$$

## 3.2 Some Simple Patterns of Chemical Reactivity

- combination reactions
- decomposition reactions
- combustion reactions

### Combination and Decomposition Reactions
> In __combination reactions__ two or more substances react to form one product.

basically, multiple things on the left side

> In a __decomposition reaction__ one substance undergoes a reaction to produce two or more other substances

multiple things on the right side

### Combustion Reactions

> __Combustion reactions__ are rapid reactions that produce a flame.

_note:_ hydrocarbons are compounds that contain only carbon and hydrogen, such as $$CH_4 \text{and} C_2H_2$$
