- sig figs
- mass volume density
- naming

### sig figs

55 gallon drums shipping chemical waste

the density of the chemical waste is $$1.5942 \cdot \frac{2g}{cm^3}$$ mass of chemical waste is in lbs

gallons to quarts to lt to cm^3

$$ mass = volue \cdot density$$


### Isotopes

what is an isotope?

> has different number of neutrons in it

if they give you something like this $$^{-40}Ar$$ how would you figure it out?

You'd figure out the number of protons in it (via the periodic table) and then you'd subtract that number from the example. The resulting number is the amount of neutrons in it.

$$80% \to 80amu$$

$$20% \to 82amu$$

$$(\frac{80}{100} \cdot 80amu) + (\frac{20}{100} \cdot 82amu)$$

### Naming

- __ionic__
  + if you're naming nonionic you have to indicate the number of molecules in that molecule
  + prefix-cadion prefix name + anion name
  + $$PCl_5$$ - 
  + $$N_2O_3$$ - dinitrogen trioxygen?
  + $$MgCO_3$$ - magnesium carbonate
    * polyatomic ions
    * $$SO^4$$
    * $$SO^3$$
    * $$CO^3$$
    * $$PO^4$$
- __nonionic__
  + $$MgCl_2$$ - magnesium chloride
  + 

example:

name this: $$PCL_5$$

name this: $$MgCl_2$$


the mane difference between a metal and a nonmetal is how far apart they are.


## chapter 3

Why do we need to balance a chemical equation?

> It's telling you the ratios of the compounds. It's telling you this in terms of mols

> if they ever give you anything in an equation other than moles, you have to get it back to moles.


### balancing equations

$$B_2O_3 + HF \to BG_3 + H_2O$$

solve oxygen last because it's usually in a lot of other things

$$B_2O_3 + 6HF \to 2BG_3 + 3H_2O$$

### Chemical reaction chemical equations

theoretical yield ---> $$2H_2 + O_2 \to 2H_2O$$

- 25g of hydrogen
- 225g of oxygen

your actual yield is 365g

a. how many grams of water will you produce in grams?

what is the limiting reagent (reactant)

1. convert everything into mols, mole = $$\frac{sample mass}{molar mass}$$

moles $$H = \frac{25g}{2g/m} = 12.5$$moles. Need 6.25 moles

moles $$O_2 = \frac{225g}{32g/m} = 7.03 moles$$. We need 14.06 moles

what is the limiting reactant? Hydrogen

$$2 moles H \to 2 moles H_2O$$

$$12.5 moles H$$ and $$12.5 moles H_2O$$

2. convert from moles to grams - multiply by the molar mass


$$ grams = moles \dot molar mass$$

$$ 12.5 moles H_2O \cdot 18\frac{g}{mole}$$


3. find your percent yield

$$ % = \frac{actual}{theoretical} \cdot 100$$

$$ % = \frac{165g}{225g} \cdot 100$$
