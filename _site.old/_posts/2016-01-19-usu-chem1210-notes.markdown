- Little bit about Chris

## How to be successful

- Read lectures beforehand
- Take good notes
  + Print out lectures slides
  + listen for clues
  + highlight areas you don't understand
- Practice Quizzes
  + __Exam questions based on quizzes__

## Sig Figs (significant figures)

> We're only as accurate as our least accurate instrument

### Rules

- Zeros between digits are always significant
- zeros at the beginning of a number are never significant 
- zeros at the end of a number are:
  + significant if there is a decimal point
  + not significant if htere is no decimal point

### Uncertainty

- Round the last answer

1. $$1.89 * 10^4 - 3 sf$$
2. $$1.857910005 * 10^4 - 10 sf$$
3. $$5.89 * 10^-4 - 3 sf$$
4. $$5.1 * 10^-9 - 2 sf$$
5. $$4.8940000 * 10^-1 - 8 sf$$

### Calculations

- always truncate at the end of calculations, not before
- You always truncate to the smallest measurement

## Dimensional Analysis

$$\text{given unit }x \frac{\text{desired unit}}{\text{given unit}}  = \text{desired unit}$$

1. What am I converting to
2. What conversion factor do I need
3. Do the units cancel
4. Does this make sense

Problem for next time

How far has the millennium Falcon traveled going 700 $$\frac{mi}{h}$$ after 35.0 min?
