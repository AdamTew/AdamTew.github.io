question:

Dimensional Analysis - what did I do wrong?

how far has the Millennium Falcon traveled going 700 $$\frac{mi}{h} after 35.0 min?

a. 657,000 m

b. __657.3__ m

c. 11,000 m

d. 254,100 m

$$\frac{1.61 km}{1 mi}$$

$$\frac{700 mi}{hr} \cdot \frac{1.61 km}{mi} \cdot \frac{1000m}{1km} \cdot \frac{1h}{60m} \cdot \frac{1min}{60s}$$

- exact numbers - when you invented the numbers you don't have to worry about significant figures on conversions

## Nomanclature

- cadions are positive ions
  + some people tihnk that cats are positive
- anions are negative ions

if you're naming something it's the same name as the metal

sodium
aluminum
ferrous 
ferrick

- non-metals

- __ate__ - is most commone
- __ite__ - is less common
- __Hypo__ - least
- __per__ -
