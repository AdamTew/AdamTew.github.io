# Lesson 4 (Chapter 1)

cpu time = cpu clock cycles x clock cycle time

cpu clock cycles / clock rate

CPI clock cycles per instruction



Example you'd see on an exam

computer a: cycle time = 250ps, CPI = 2.0
computer b: cycle time = 500ps, CPI = 1.2

same ISA

Which is faster and by how much?

cpu time A = instruction count * cpi * cycle time

cpu time B = instruction count * cpi * cycle time

$$\frac{CPU Time_B}{CPU Time_A} = \frac{I \cdot 600ps}{I \cdot 500ps} = 1.2

__answer__ A is faster by 1.2

- ps = pico seconds
- IPC = instructions per cycle
- CPI = Cycles per instruction

## SPEC CPU Benchmark

### MIPS

- MIPS - Millions of Instructions Per Second

calculation to determine the MIPS

MIPS = $$\frac{\text{Instruction Count}}{\text{Execution Time} \cdot 10^6}$$

__pitfall__ you can't compare MIPS for separate computers
