- Empirical formula - ratios
- Combustion analysis - determining what's in the x

> Take grams, go to moles, use moles for the calculations, got back to grams

> The thing that there's not enough of is the limiting reagent
> 
> The thing we have more of is called the excess reactant

$$% \text{Yield} = \frac{\text{Actual Yield}}{\text{Theoretical Yield}} \cdot 100$$

## Chapter 4

### Reactions in Water

- body weight is 60% water
- aqueous solution - disolves in water
- __solvent__ - what disolves stuff
- __solute__ - stuff that gets disolved
- __Solution__ - the result of the two
- if something comes apart if water into positive and negative charges means it will conduct electricity
- __electrolyte__ - something that conducts electricity in water (salt is, sugar is not)

- NaCl (salt) $$\to Na^+ Cl^-$$
