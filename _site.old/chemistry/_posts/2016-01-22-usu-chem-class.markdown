## Atomic weigh/mass

$$6.01 \cdot 10^{23}$$ is an important number

- Molecular weight is the combination of all the atomic weights in the compound

## Percent Composition

total weight would be everything added together

the weight of a given element would be individual atomic weight divided by the total weight

## Moles

a mole is $$6 \cdot 10^{23}$$ of that thing

1 mole of O atoms weigh 16g

the mass of a single atom is $$\frac{16g/mol}{6 \cdot 10^{23}} = 2.7 \cdot 10^{-23} g/atom$$

Example: Benzene $$C_6H_6$$

What is the mass of a mole?

$$13 \cdot 10^{-22} g/molecule$$

## Empirical Formula

Good for working with percents

1. take percents and put them in terms of numbers of moles
2. figure out how many atoms per moles there are
3. find the ratios between the resulting numbers (put them in integer form

"__Stress something__ a lot of eleements will weight more, so it looks like there more if you have more of one element, but that's not always the case"

## Combustion Analysis

__Important thing to remember__ some things come from x, not only from the $$O_2$$

1. convert to moles


__This is where you need to practice__

## Balanced Equations

>Balanced equations are extremely useful. Can be used to tell nearly anything aboutquantities

> The reason we want it balanced is because it will tell us how much we'll get
