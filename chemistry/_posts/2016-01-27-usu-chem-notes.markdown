## reactions

precipitation reaction

- precipitate - when two elements don't want to stay in solution, they make crystals
- spectator ions

3 ways to write precipitation reactions

- net ionic - remove spectator ions
- ionic - ions with spectator ions
- molecular - don't recognize them as ions, just molecules

## Acid-Base Chemistry

> definition: acids release $$H^+$$ ions in solution

- monoprotic
- diprotic - $$H_2SO_4 \to 3H^+ + PO_$^{3-}$$
- triprotic -

> bases react with $$H^+$$ ions to lower their concentration: $$OH^- + H^+ \to HOH$$

- strong acids and bases strong electrolytes - they are c ompletely ionized in solution
- weak acids and bases are weak electrolytes - they are partially ionized in solution

- neutralization occurs when a solution of an acid and a base are mixed
