Chapter 5 - Energy

### __systems__

- They need boundaries, even if they're imaginary
- __closed__ - energy can cross the barrier, but not matter. Heat energy, but not mass
- __work__ - force is a push or pull on an object. Work is the product of force applied to an object over a distance. Force times distance (displacement) $$w = F \times d$$
- __Energy__ - the work done to move an object against a force. Heat can transfer enery between two objects. Always goes from hot to cold. Energy is the capacity to do work or transfer heat

### The First Law of Thermodynamics

- E can transfer from one form to another, and can move but E is conserved
    + Energy cannot be created or destroyed
    + energy of (system + surroudings) is constant

- __q__ - energy
- __w__ - work

__Remember that when transferring heat, one is gaining energy, the other is performing work. If heat is leaving the system, then q is negative__

$$\delta E = q + w$$

- __Endothermic__: absorbs heat from the surroundings ( feels cold)
- __Exothermic__: transfers heat to the surroudgins (feels hot)
- __State function__ depends oly on present conditions not on past history. They don't depend on the route you're taking
    + some examples are latitute, altitude, score of a football game, bank account amount
- __Enthalpy (H)__ - closely related to energy, but defined slightly differently. Different definition neede because chemical reactions can release head __and__ do work. Heat that goes between the system and surroundings carried out under constant pressure
    + Example explosion that pusheda piston

$$w = - P \delta V$$ - assumes constant P resistance

- __P__ - external pressure

$$\delta H = \delta (Eee + PV)$$

### Enthalpy of Reaction

chemical reactions that cause heating would be exothermic reactions. An example is when you oxidize paper, it burns and causes heat

enthalpy reaction

$$A + B \to C + D$$
H1              H2

__Important rules__

- when we reverse a reaction, we change the sign of $$\delta H$$
- Change in enthalpy depends on state
