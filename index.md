I like to code.

Primarily, I use web technologies, because that's what I do for work.
Recently, I've worked a lot with [react.js](https://facebook.github.io/react/) and
the node version of [pattern lab](https://github.com/pattern-lab/patternlab-node).
But I also play around with other stuff for school and fun.
